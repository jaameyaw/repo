## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries


### What I learned

Your awesome project help me challenged myself using the CSS grid to arrange the layout. I've understood the CSS grid well with your project and also been able to build responsive web. I've also notice there's actually an svg you can use as background image. Seeing the number of code lines made me very proud and happy to continue learning how to code. 
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: url('images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg');
}
```

### Continued development

I'm yet to complete CSS. It's left css transitions, css animation, css transform. Afterwards I want to learn Javascript to help me in my frontend career.
